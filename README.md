# Motorbike Dashboard Implementation for STM32F4 Discovery Board
Overview
This project implements a simulated motorbike dashboard using the STM32F4 Discovery Board. The system detects various user inputs such as throttle, clutch, signal lights, and gears, and displays the current state of the simulated vehicle on a screen.

# Features
Throttle Detection: Simulates the throttle input from the user.
Clutch Detection: Simulates the clutch input from the user.
Signal Lights: Simulates left and right signal lights.
Gear Detection: Detects the current gear of the simulated motorbike.
State Display: Shows the current state of the motorbike on a screen.
Hardware Requirements
STM32F4 Discovery Board: The main microcontroller board used for the project.
Expansion Board for STM32F4 Discovery Board: Provides additional connectivity and functionality.
Software Requirements
STM32CubeIDE: Integrated development environment for STM32 microcontrollers.
STM32CubeMX: Initialization code generator for STM32 microcontrollers.
HAL Library: Hardware Abstraction Layer for STM32 microcontrollers.
Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Download and install STM32CubeIDE from ST's website.
Download and install STM32CubeMX from ST's website.
Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone

# Project Setup
Open STM32CubeMX and configure the STM32F4 Discovery Board with the necessary peripherals:
GPIOs for throttle, clutch, signal lights, and gears.
Display interface (e.g., LCD or OLED).
Generate the initialization code and open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
Build and flash the project to the STM32F4 Discovery Board.

# Usage

Power on the STM32F4 Discovery Board.
Use the connected inputs (throttle, clutch, signal lights, and gears) to interact with the system.
Observe the simulated motorbike state on the display.
